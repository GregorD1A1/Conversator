An app that likes a profile, texts girls from tinder and dates them. 

Operation: 
1. Once a day clicks (likes or dislikes) a certain number of girls according to set criteria. (clicks from 2 to 6 girls, the criteria for selection are having min 3 photos and age min 20 years)
2. Once a day to a certain number of girls sends a message asking about interests (stage 1), with name personalization. (sends from 2 to 4 girls)
3. 2 times a day writes back to the girls. At stage 2, she analyzes her interests and selects the appropriate text based on them, also analyzes whether she has asked about my interests; at stage 3, she continues the topic of one of her interests, and elaborates on my interests if she has asked; at stage 4, she proposes a meeting; later, if she gets a response, she sends an email and a notification to her phone.

Given the cooperation with a third-party application (tinder), not designed to integrate with the bot, this application has a mechanism for self-catching errors and notifying by phone when they occur. Due to tinder's extensive anti-bot mehanisms, the application built to pretend to be human in action. The application will ultimately run on a Raspberry Pi microcomputer to ensure round-the-clock operation.
