Introducing Conversator, an innovative application designed to automate Tinder conversations and schedule dates with potential matches. Using a pre-determined set of text messages and a hard-coded conversation tree, this smart solution will run as a process on a Raspberry Pi.

Outsmart the dating game with this comprehensive app that simplifies profile engagement, delivers personalized messages, and schedules dates.

Operation:
1. Daily, Conversator will evaluate profiles according to specific criteria (must have a minimum of 3 photos and be at least 20 years old), and perform a suitable action - either like or dislike - on 2-6 profiles.
2. Every day, the app sends personalized messages with name integration to 2-4 potential matches, inquiring about their interests (Stage 1).
3. Twice a day, Conversator replies to messages in the following stages:
   - Stage 2: The app analyzes the interests of the girls and selects an appropriate text based on the information; it also detects whether they have asked about the user's interests.
   - Stage 3: The conversation continues by discussing one of their interests, and if they have asked, delving into the user's interests.
   - Stage 4: A meeting is proposed; if a response is received, an email and a notification will be sent to the user's phone.

To overcome potential third-party application issues (such as Tinder), Conversator is designed to self-detect errors and notify users via phone when they occur. The app is built to mimic human behavior, bypassing Tinder's extensive anti-bot mechanisms. As a result, Conversator offers a seamless and efficient user experience.

Designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi microcomputer, Conversator ensures round-the-clock operation, taking the stress out of the dating scene and making it simpler for users to connect with potential matches.
